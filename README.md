# ⌨️ **NESTYPES README** 

## 🌟 **About the Project**
As a **touch typing enthusiast**, I was inspired by the minimalistic typing website **Monkeytype**, so I decided to create my own version: **Nestypes**.

This website’s **main function** is to track user input and measure typing speed, displaying results on the **"Results" page**. While some aspects can still be improved—such as **cursor movement, positioning, and speed calculations**—the **core functionality** is complete.
